# COVID-19 Datasets

For a part of the materials, I rely on publically-available COVID datasets. I leverage these data sets because it is one of the most comprehensive data sets that is open to anyone. It's also complex and you can work with almost any Python concept with it.

The loose files above are for some training modules, but I have concise folders for case studies with a given date of download.

## Data Sources:

- Covid Tracking Project by The Atlantic
- Our World in Data (OWID)
- United States Center for Disease Control (CDC)
