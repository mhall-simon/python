**Welcome to My GitHub Reference Repository for Python!**

## Folder Overview

### Data

This folder is where I store all of the necessary data files for the Python reference materials. You probably won't have to manually go in here-ever.

### Modules

This folder is where I keep all of the content modules and notebooks. This is the fun one to look through and learn from!
