**Welcome to My GitHub Reference Repository for Python!**

# Have You Never Looked At Python Before?

You're going to start by navigating into the *modules* folder, and then *module-01*!

Once you're in that folder, read the README.md document that will be rendered below the directory (files).

# Folders Overview

## Modules

This folder is where I keep all of the content modules and notebooks. This is the fun one to look through and learn from!

## Case Studies

This folder contains various case studies I have put together using Python, and are valuable resources to look through and learn from.

## Recordings

This folder contains recordings of previous trainings and any unique materials. (Usually just module notebooks with tweaks done during training.)

## Data

This folder is where I store all of the necessary data files for the Python reference materials. You probably won't have to manually go in here-ever.

## HTML

This folder contains html cheat sheets. You usually won't look at these directly, as I have preview links set for these in the modules!

## Exercises

This folder contains exercises that will help you learn python! You'll only get better through practice!
