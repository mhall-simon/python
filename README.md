# python

**Welcome to My GitHub Reference Repository for Python!**

## Folder Overview

### Modules

This folder is where I keep all of the content modules and notebooks. This is the fun one to look through and learn from!

### Data

This folder is where I store all of the necessary data files for the Python reference materials. You probably won't have to manually go in here-ever.

### Case Studies

This folder contains various case studies I have put together using Python, and are valuable resources to look through and learn from.

### HTML

This folder contains html cheat sheets. You usually won't look at these directly, as I have preview links set for these in the modules!
