# Introduction to Python

If you're here and have never coded / seen python and want to add it into your data analysis toolkit, you're in the right place!

Python is a powerful tool for working with data, however, it presents a few challenges as you need to learn programming to work with it.

Python (or R) are great tools to learn because some processes and analysis in Excel that are complex and take a long time to build out can be easily done in python in just a few lines of code!

Why is this? Python is an open source programming language with a strong community of open source packages to use! That means you rarely have to reinvent the wheel, someone probably has built a package for almost anything you want to do.

To get started, you're going to need just a few things:

- Python Installation
- Jupyter Notebook
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Thankfully, tech has progressed a long way and you can access all of this right in your browser!

I strongly recommend coding in the beginning on Google Colab (colab.research.google.com) because it provides everything you need right in one place, and you can even store everything right in Google Drive.

I've introduced a few concepts that I should go through more in depth:

## **Jupyter Notebook**

A Jupyter Notebook (files with .ipynb extension) is a flexible document that allows us to do two primary things:

1. Edit, Store, and Run Our Python Code
2. Add Markdown (Text) Cells

We use Jupyter Notebooks often over writing code in plain text files because they provide rich output, and are easier to work with and read from.

## **Python Code**

Python code is the specific programming instructions that we're going to run, and they go within code cells on a Jupyter Notebook.

It'll look something like this:

```python
x = 10
y = 15

z = x + y
```

## **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**

Google Colab is an example of an IDE! It's the interface that allows us to build out our Jupyter Notebooks, write python code, and execute code!

It looks something like this:

Other examples of IDEs are Jupyter Lab, Spyder, and PyCharm!

Spyder Looks Like This:

For the most part, they all do the same thing! Some editors have useful features, and my favorite is personally Spyder. However, Google Colab is a great place to just started!

If you're behind a firewall and cannot access Google Colab, I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and using the Jupyter Lab IDE in the beginning. Once you're a bit more experienced, I love the featureset that Spyder offers!

Now that you're done reading this, start exploring the modules above to learn more about Python!
