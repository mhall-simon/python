# Module 10: SKLearn Foundations

In this collection, we have a lot of notebooks that go together! It's a good thing to look at them in order, to get more context, however, each notebook is still a good source on its own!

***Note:*** Since the version of SKlearn and Python you have may result in dissimilar results, I will provide Docker images to ensure compatibility. If you want to get close and not worry about Docker, I'm building the notebooks on Anaconda Python 3.8, with SKLearn version 0.23.1.
