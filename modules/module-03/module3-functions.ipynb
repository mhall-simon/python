    "\n",
    "`def` declares to Python that a function declaration follows\n",
    "\n",
    "`my_function():` is the name of the function with the standard syntax of `():` following\n",
    "\n",
    "`input` and any other names are placeholders for arguments / inputs for our function!\n",
    "\n",
    "`result = input ** input` is the logic inside the program. `result` is a local variable, it is NOT accessible outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`return` tells Python that we want to return a value when executing. This needs to be captured in the main program. *(Returning a value is optional when building a function)*\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, we call functions with the syntax `function()`, and include any required inputs in `()`\n",
