    "## Part 1: For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops in Python allow us to run an iterative chunk of code across an array of items. This could be in a list, set, dictionary, or even just characters in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    # ###\n",
    "    # This code is executed on each item in my list\n",
    "    # ###\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The placeholder `item` can be replaed with anything. For numbers, we often use `i` or `n` to denote significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop creates a local variable `item` that is able to be used during the execution of the single loop."
